        <h3>Impeachment Process</h3>
        <p>Impeachment is the process whereby a federal official may be 
            brought up on charges and then removed from 
            office. The House of Representatives, also known as Congress has the right to start the impeachment 
            process by presenting articles of impeachment to Congress.
            Once this has been done then an inquiry can be started.
            Multiple people from Congress are selected to carry out the 
            inquiry and when they have finished their inquiry they present 
            the findings to Congress who vote whether to impeach or not.
            This is a straight forward majority vote. If enough votes are 
            given to support impeachment then the impeachment will proceed 
            to trial. This is carried out in the Senate. The people who led the  
            inquiry will act as prosecutors for the case.</p>
        <p>If the federal officer being impeached happens to be the President 
            then the Supreme Court Justice will preside over the trial. In all 
            cases, if the federal official is found guilty then they will be 
            removed from office. Congress can also stipulate that the federal 
            official will never be able to hold office again.</p>
        <h3>History of Impeachment</h3>
        <p>In history, the house has initiated impeachment proceedings against 60 
            federal officials. Of the 60 that have started the impeahcment process 
            only 8 have resulted in conviction and removal from office. All of these 
            have been judges.</p>
        <p>Three presidents, Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump have been 
            impeached but none have been found guilty and so were not removed from office.</p>
        <p>Impeachment was included in the constitution to protect against federal officials 
            abusing their positions. It was modeled after the British system. Impeachment 
            is used for treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. These terms 
            have long been debated about what they mean exactly.</p>
        <p>Impeachment had it's beginnings in Revolutionary-era America when individual states 
            would impeach officials in cases of "maladministration" or "corruption". During the 
            Constitutional Convention the Framers looked at the details of impeachment. There was 
            some debate over why impeachment would be needed seeing as some federal officials had 
            limited terms and if they were caught doing inappropriate things then they would 
            naturally be voted out. However, it was argued that magistrated would be strong enough to 
            impeach independent of general elections in order to hold federal officials accountable 
            to the people.</p>
        <p>After deciding that impeachment was a necessary part of the constitution there was more 
            debate as to the reasons for impeaching someone. Treason and bribery were fully supported 
            but James Madison reasoned that other 'High crimes and misdemeanors' was a better description 
            of suitable causes and is so included in the reasons for impeachment. However, the exact 
            understanding of what constitutes 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors' is still hotly debated.</p>
